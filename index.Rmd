* Create plots using R packages to explore basic data trends

* Create maps in R to explore/report spatial patterns

[R](https://www.r-project.org/) is a language for statistical computing as well as a general purpose programming language. Increasingly, it has become one of the primary languages used in data science for data analysis, modeling, and visualization. This workshop will provide attendees with a starting point for continued learning and use of R. We will cover a variety of commonly used file types (i.e., `.csv`, `.xlsx`, `.shp`) used in analysis, as well as provide resources for more foundational learning.

## Software requirements

Please setup a computer/laptop with the latest version of RStudio and R installed.  Download the compressed [data](https://github.com/ucd-cws/CABW2020_R_training/raw/main/data/datazip.zip) folder and make sure it is accessible on your computer.  The [setup instructions](01_setup_R.html) will guide you through the rest of the process.  Take note of the required R packages that you must also download and install.  Please contact the instructors with any questions or issues related to setup.  

If for whatever reason you can't get RStudio installed with the right packages, we can help you set up a free [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/) account which you can use for the workshop.
