**What is Code Club?**

A chance to learn some basic data workflows (here in R), as well as:

* project management and data organization

* principles of tidy data and data wrangling

* a chance to learn from each other!

:::

<br>


The concept of Code Club or De-Bugging Buddies is based on [this paper](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008119&type=printable) by Hagan et al. (2020). The main idea is that we usually spend time presenting results or working on manuscripts and presentations, but not much time talking about how we do things with data (analysis, cleaning, storing, sharing).

The key rules are:

 - Be respectful
 - Be open to learning new methods
 - Learn and experiment!
 - Aim to reach all levels
 - Participate

## Software requirements for R

Please setup a computer/laptop with the latest version of RStudio and R installed. [Setup instructions](w_setup_R.html) will guide you through the rest of the process.  If for whatever reason you can't get RStudio installed with the right packages, check out and set up a free [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/) account which you can use freely, up to 15 hours a month. Instructions [here](w_RStudio_cloud.html).
